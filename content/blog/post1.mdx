# Getting Started with Markdown in React

This is a simple example of using **Markdown** inside a React-based blog application.

## Features

- Render headings, bold and italic text
- Support code blocks
- Use frontmatter metadata (like title, date, tags)

## Code Example

```tsx
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";

<ReactMarkdown>
  {`# Hello Markdown! \nThis is a React component.`}
</ReactMarkdown>
